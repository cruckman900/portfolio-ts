# The Story of This Site

This site began as a whisper‚Äîjust a r√©sum√©, just a portfolio.

But it evolved into a creative playground, a poetic survival platform, and a contributor-ready launchpad.

From Netlify secret scanning to dynamic blog architecture, every pixel is intentional.

And it‚Äôs only just beginning.
